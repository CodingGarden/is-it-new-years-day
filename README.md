## Tech

* Front-end - Vue.js 2.6 + Vue Composition API
* Back-end - Node.js + Express + Socket.io

## Ideas

* docd27 - how about multiple countdowns for some different capital cities? 
* docd27 - curl support / no JS support
* bobsparadox - per user settings to hide / show things
* beganovich - How about detecting user's light/dark system theme? window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches (reactive) or just media
